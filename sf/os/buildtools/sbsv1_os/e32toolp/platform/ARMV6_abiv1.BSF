# Description:
# This BSF file is to support building for ARMV6 architecture. The options specified here are same as for ARMV5 except 
# the --cpu 6 option in INVARIANT_OPTIONS. This specifies to compiler to compile for generic ARMV6. If any other 
# specific options are required such as --cpu ARM1136J-S, etc, then it can be done via a different BSF file
# NOTE: The options specified here for the compiler disable the unaligned memory access.
